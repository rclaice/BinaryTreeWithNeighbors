# BinaryTreeWithNeighbors
Binary Tree Traversal Adding Right Neighbors

This is the code and tests for a btree navigator to traverse a binary tree adding "right" neighbors to all the nodes using a BFS and Queue. 

Problem Statement is below
/**
Given a binary tree, write a function that adds right sibling pointers to each of the nodes.
For instance, given:

     A
    / \
   B   C
  / \   \ 
 D   E   F

The function should modify the tree to be:

     A
    / \
   B-->C
  / \   \ 
 D-->E-->F
 
 
 **/
